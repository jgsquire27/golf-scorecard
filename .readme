--Notes:
I think I'm already loading my api into my page
I could create an 18 hole table, then have styling remove that when 9 hole is
  selected. Would default to 9 hole.

--Questions:
I'm confused about step 6?
Do i need to be able to select the 18 hole option?
How do I make it so players can input their scores into the table?

--things I need help with:

I need to add ID's onto created elements
I need help loading the api data into objects. example: loading the yardage,
  adding all the yardage values together and adding the sum value into a td element
I need to add input functionality so players can add their own score
I need to get the out score to update

Project Golf Scorecard App:

Required:

1. Required: Create the main scoring table with columns for each hole, 
out score, in score, and total score.

2. Required: Use the golf data API to bring in the data for the golf course(s).

3. Required: Create a row that loads yardage, handicap, and par for each hole 
from the course data and displays it in the table. The row should have a 
"total" column for the sum of all 18 holes.

4. Required: Create a row to keep track of a player's score. This row should allow users to enter their name and a score for each hole. When a user types in a score for a hole, the out, in, and total columns should update

5. Required: Add some CSS to style the card to look like an actual golf card.

6. Required: Allow users to select which tee they will be using (Men's, Women's, Pro, Amateur, etc.). All players will play from the same tee.

7. Required: Allow up to four players in your scorecard.

8. Required: Minimum of 5+ commits
